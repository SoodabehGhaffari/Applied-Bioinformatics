Applied bioinformatics:homework for the week one
Soodabeh Ghaffari 

Lecture 1:
1.	Done

2.	I followed the bookâ€™s instruction for the conda/mamba installation:
	a.	URL=https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
	b.	curl $URL > miniconda-installer.sh
	c.	bash miniconda-installer.sh -b

3.	We can check the version of Conda by conda -V, its version is 4.8.3. There are also other ways by installing a specific software with conda, and so on.

4.	Yes, I installed samtools by conda install -c bioconda samtools

5.	Samtools version is 1.13(using htslib 1.13)


Lecture 2:
1. The command is not described in the book and I think it is really usefull:
du --display disk usage statistics
I would use this command when there is shortage of storage space in my home/work directory and I want to identify files/folders with the greatest size.

2. The following is the list of features of du. Without using (-h), the output is not easy to read. The flag (-h) makes output human-readable.
 

     -a      Display an entry for each file in a file hierarchy.

     -c      Display a grand total.

     -d depth
             Display an entry for all files and directories depth directories deep.

     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed, symbolic links in file hierarchies are
             not followed.

     -h      "Human-readable" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Ter-
             abyte and Petabyte.

     -I mask
             Ignore files and directories matching the specified mask.

     -g      Display block counts in 1073741824-byte (1-Gbyte) blocks.

     -k      Display block counts in 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks.

     -L      Symbolic links on the command line and in file hierarchies are followed.

     -m      Display block counts in 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks.

     -P      No symbolic links are followed.  This is the default.

     -r      Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files that cannot be opened,
             and so on.  This is the default case.  This option exists solely for conformance with
             X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4 (``XPG4'').

     -s      Display an entry for each specified file.  (Equivalent to -d 0)

     -x      File system mount points are not traversed

3.    ls -lh

4. rm -i

5. done
6. done
7. 
	The required path is ~/work/IPRO_Suite/../NewIPRO_Suite/./IPRO/

	Yes, I can make a path that is five deep, even though my folders are nested less than five deep by using the current directory or parent directory such as the above path.
