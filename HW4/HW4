For lecture 7, I chose the database below:

AmtDB: a database of ancient human mitochondrial genomes
This is where you can discover an up-to-date list of the mitochondrial sequences that have been published from ancient DNA samples (aDNA). The database's major focus is on anatomically modern Homo sapiens samples from the late Paleolithic to roughly the Iron Age, with a geographic concentration on the Euroasian region. They make both the mtDNA sequences (in FASTA format) and the sample metadata (ID, date, geolocation, site, culture, mtDNA haplogroup, etc.) accessible in a comma-separated (CSV) text file for download.
Advantage:They have two major updates annually.
Disadvantage:
Their samples are not balanced originate-wise. Therefore, the results of analysis of the samples from this website might be biased towards European.
