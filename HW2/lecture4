ARS:A sequence that can autonomously replicate, as a plasmid, when transformed into a bacterial host.

ARS is a origin of replication which is part of replicon.


gene of interest:PCSK9
yes, it is annotated. 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9

PCSK9-LDLR:A protein complex consisting of the serine protease PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-9) and a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Interaction typically occurs through the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR, and complex formation promotes degradation of the LDLR through the endosome/lysosome pathway.

It is a common observed function.
